        <h2>Impact of Cyberbullying on Learners</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This post talks about how cyberbullying can impact students' feelings, friendships, and schoolwork. It highlights the dangers it can lead to, like feeling sad, anxious, and missing school.</p>
        <h4>Content Ideas</h4>
        <h5>Information: Discuss the emotional and psychological effects of cyberbullying</h5>
        <p>Cyberbullying can cause a lot of anxiety for victims, making them worry all the time about negative messages online. This stress can make it hard for them to focus on daily activities.</p>
        <p>Many victims also feel depressed, which means they feel sad and hopeless. This emotional pain can lead them to pull away from friends and things they used to enjoy, making them feel isolated.</p>
        <p>Victims often have low self-esteem because hurtful comments can make them doubt themselves. They might also develop a fear of going to school or social events because they are scared of facing their bullies.</p>
        <p>Changes in behavior are common too. Victims might become more withdrawn, easily annoyed, or even aggressive. Cyberbullying can also hurt their school performance, causing them to get poor grades and lose interest in their studies.</p>
        <p>In serious cases, victims may think about self-harm or suicide, showing how important it is to get help. Friends, family, and teachers need to notice these signs and offer support.</p>
